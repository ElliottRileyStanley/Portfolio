        <p>In this puzzle, you have to find all words you can make with these letters. You cannot use letters more than once. I made a solver to find all words in Python, and used a module called PyAutoGui to type the answers. It takes about a minute to fully input all answers, with it only taking a few seconds to find the answers. There is also a second version of this game, where the rules are the same but you are always required to include the middle letter, which I also incorporated into the solver.</p>
